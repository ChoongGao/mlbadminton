# mlbadminton

## Project Overview
In this project, I'll use an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and Machine Learning to classify and learn to differentiate between three badminton swings: the **smash**, the **clear**, and the **drop**.

## Required Items
- Badminton racket
- Witmotion BWT61

## Goals
- Gather data for all types of swings
- Use pandas to format data into dataframes
- Train the model using scikit-learn
- Test the final model
- Compare and evaluate models with differing amounts of training data
