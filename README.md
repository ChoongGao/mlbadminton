## Project Overview
In this project, I'll use an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and Machine Learning to classify and learn to differentiate between two badminton swings: the **smash** and the **drop**.

## Required Items
- Badminton racket
- Witmotion BWT61

## Goals
- Gather data using pandas for both types of swings
- Train the model using scikit-learn
- Compare and evaluate models with differing amounts of training data
